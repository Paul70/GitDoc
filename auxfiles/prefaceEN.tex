The intention of this document is not to write an absolute beginners guide for git or explain everything in detail again. 
Therefore, I recommend reading other articles or references throughout the text which helped me a lot to understand how Git really
works under the surface. 
\\
This report is more a protocol of 
the problems I encountered when working with git so far. I summarize these problems in so called "User Stories"
(they are highlighted in yellow within the text) and describe my solutions to cope with this tasks.
