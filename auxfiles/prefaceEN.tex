The intention of this document is not to write an absolute beginners guide for git. It is more a protocol of 
the problems I encountered when working with git so far. I summarize these problems in so called "User Stories"
(they are highlighted in yellow within the text) and describe my solutions to cope with this tasks. In other words, 
this work is my own reference manual to git.


During the process of collecting these answers, I got more and more insight of how git really works under the surface. 
This is also the other purpose of my motivation to write everything down: Really understanding what your are doing while solving 
your daily git problems. Maybe this is helpful for people who started working with git and spend much time on stackoverflow;)
